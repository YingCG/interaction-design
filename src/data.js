    Title: "Project Overview",
    Description:
      "A triple diamond makes planning, updating stakeholders on progress and working with development teams much clearer. It also bakes into interactive design' workflow the need for them to work on the project after prototype testing finishes. ",
  },
  {
    Title: "Diamond 1: Research",
    Description:
      "The output of the first diamond is a set of hypotheses. Gathering user research (and other types) is simply to form insight. At Milkymap we use diary studies, customer arenas and customer safaris. The value of insight is simply to understand user pains and opportunities and if your existing product is doing a good job. All of this rolls up into the output in the form of hypotheses. You’ll use these in the next diamond.",
  },
  {
    Title: "Diamond 2: Proof of concept",
    Description:
      "Using the hypotheses, the second diamond takes us through ideation and prototyping to create a proof of concept. A proof of concept is a prototype or proposition test that is just good enough to get test results to demonstrate its potential value of it. Working this way, the team can move very quickly because you’re only doing the work that is needed to move to the next milestone. At this point, the team and stakeholders review the test results to decide if you should continue with the project or not.",
  },
  {
    Title: "Diamond 3: Prototype and test",
    Description:
      "Using the proof of concept you can finish designing the screens, flows, UI, copy etc safe in the knowledge that this project has the thumbs up from users and stakeholders and test results to back it all up. The output from the third diamond is a live release that you can get qual and quant test results from. If all has gone well, a new product/feature is born and the continuous development continues.",
