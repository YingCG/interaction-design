        "The output of the first diamond is a set of hypotheses. This is usually a website/ app selling the idea before you have built it. Designing big products from scratch, we can find out what potential users think of the idea before spending time and effort on prototyping. Gathering user research (and other types) is simply to form insight. We use diary studies, customer arenas and customer safaris. The value of insight is simply to understand user pains and opportunities and if your existing product is doing a good job. All of this rolls up into the output in the form of hypotheses. You’ll use these in the next diamond.",

        "Using the hypotheses, the second diamond takes us through ideation and prototyping to create a proof of concept. A proof of concept is a prototype or proposition test that is just good enough to get test results to demonstrate its potential value of it. Working this way, the team can move very quickly because you’re only doing the work that is needed to move to the next milestone.  To give a prototype proof of concept that you can usability test, by designing out all the journeys. At this point, the team and stakeholders review the test results to decide if you should continue with the project or not.",

The output from the third diamond is a live release that you can get qual and quant test results from. If all has gone well, a new product/feature is born and the continuous development continues.",
