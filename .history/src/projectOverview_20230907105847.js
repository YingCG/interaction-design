      Memento Media is a creative industry startup that empowers people to save
      life's stories. When a loved one dies, we also sadly loose their stories.
      Memento Media uses storytelling and oral history practices to redefine the
      way families discover, capture and celebrate family history without
      multi-generational living family archives.
